# Classic Flow Overview
This is where all of the nodes available for implementation can be found. You can see a brief description for each node by hovering the cursor over each node.

There is also a search filter found at the beginning of the palette to quickly navigate to a desired node, rather than scrolling through.

## The Canvas
This is where the BOTs flows shall be built and managed. When creating a new flow, this shall appear blank. Simply grab and drag the desired node(s) and place them over this canvas.

They shall then be dropped onto this canvas and will be ready for implementation and customization.
