# Getting Started with the Portal
The Portal provides an interface for working with the ServisBOT Platform.

### Key sections:
* Bot Army: Interface for creating and managing Bots
* Users: Interface for creating user accounts
* Secrets: Holds API keys, and configurations for outside systems

The man differentiation between what can be done in portal vs our CLI is the ease of creating bots from templates, and managing the flows in classic flow workers.
